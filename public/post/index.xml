      <description>&lt;p&gt;William Shakespeare, born on April 23, 1564, in Stratford-upon-Avon, England, is widely regarded as the greatest playwright in the English language. His works, which include iconic tragedies like Hamlet, Macbeth, and Romeo and Juliet, as well as comedies like A Midsummer Night’s Dream and Twelfth Night, have left a lasting legacy in literature and drama. Little is known about Shakespeare&amp;rsquo;s early life, but by 1592, he had established himself as a prominent actor and playwright in London. He became a key member of the Lord Chamberlain&amp;rsquo;s Men and later the King’s Men, writing and acting in many of his plays. Shakespeare also authored poetry, including Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece, and penned 154 sonnets exploring themes of love, beauty, and mortality. After retiring to Stratford in 1613, he continued managing his estate until his death in 1616. His works were preserved in the First Folio of 1623, and his influence endures, shaping the course of literature and inspiring countless adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project is a mental health self-assessment tool designed to help individuals evaluate their emotional well-being by reflecting on common symptoms of mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and fatigue. The survey includes questions about mood, sleep patterns, appetite changes, self-esteem, and physical restlessness, alongside an inquiry into the user’s mental health history and any contributing factors such as relationship issues, past trauma, or financial stress. The goal is to provide a simple yet insightful way for users to identify potential mental health concerns and seek professional support if necessary. It aims to encourage self-awareness and provide a starting point for further mental health discussions and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
