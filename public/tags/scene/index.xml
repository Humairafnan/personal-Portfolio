      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project is a mental health self-assessment tool designed to help individuals evaluate their emotional well-being by reflecting on common symptoms of mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and fatigue. The survey includes questions about mood, sleep patterns, appetite changes, self-esteem, and physical restlessness, alongside an inquiry into the userâ€™s mental health history and any contributing factors such as relationship issues, past trauma, or financial stress. The goal is to provide a simple yet insightful way for users to identify potential mental health concerns and seek professional support if necessary. It aims to encourage self-awareness and provide a starting point for further mental health discussions and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
